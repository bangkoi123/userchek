The previous AI engineer successfully built the Webtools Validasi Nomor Telepon Multi-Tenant application from scratch, starting with an empty codebase. The development followed a phased approach, beginning with infrastructure setup (FastAPI backend, React frontend, MongoDB), then implementing authentication, core validation logic, and UI components for user and admin features.

Significant challenges included troubleshooting service startup issues (Python path in Supervisor), frontend accessibility problems (Invalid Host header due to React development server configuration), and non-responsive buttons in the Admin Panel. Each issue was systematically diagnosed and fixed. After the initial build and confirmation of core functionalities, the engineer performed a detailed gap analysis and prioritized five key enhancements. The trajectory concludes with the engineer having implemented three of these top priorities: Email Notification System, Real-time Job Progress using WebSockets, and API for Integrations (API Key Management), and is about to start the Credit Top-up System and Advanced User Management.

The goal is to create a multi-tenant web application for validating phone numbers against WhatsApp and Telegram, focusing on intuitive UX, high performance, and modern design. Key features include:

**User Pages:** Quick Check (instant single number validation), Bulk Check (CSV/Excel upload, real-time progress, downloadable results), Job History (list of past bulk checks), and a Dashboard showing credits, usage, and job status.

**Admin Pages:** Telegram Account Management (CRUD), WhatsApp Provider Settings (API keys, endpoints, multi-provider), Job Monitoring (dashboard for all tenant jobs), and Audit Logs.

**Backend Core Logic:** Number normalization, deduplication, result caching, heuristic pre-checks, provider API integration (WhatsApp via third-party, Telegram Bot API), credit-saving strategies, multi-tenancy, and robust authentication/authorization with User/Admin roles.

**UI/UX Enhancements:** Real-time progress bars, drag & drop file upload, customizable reports, Dark Mode, responsive design, elegant aesthetic (blue, grey, white palette), and micro-interactions.

**Additional Functionality:** API keys for advanced tenants, credit/usage tracking, notification system (email/in-app), rate limiting, and detailed error reporting.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (database), PyMongo (ORM), JWT (authentication), Socket.IO (WebSockets), SendGrid (email).
- **Frontend:** React (JavaScript), Tailwind CSS (styling), Context API (state), React Router (navigation), Socket.IO Client (WebSockets).
- **Deployment:** Supervisor (process management).
- **Core Logic:** Multi-tenancy, background jobs, caching, API integration.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was actively implementing the TOP 5 PRIORITIES identified in the gap analysis.
1.  **PRIORITY 1: Email Notification System** has been implemented. This involved integrating with  for email services, installing , creating a new backend file  to encapsulate email sending logic, and integrating this service into . Email notifications are now theoretically in place for job completion and low credit alerts.
2.  **PRIORITY 3: Real-time Job Progress** using WebSockets has been implemented. This required installing  on the backend and  on the frontend. The backend's  was updated to include a Socket.IO server and emit real-time progress updates during bulk validation ( function). On the frontend, new files  and  were created to manage the WebSocket connection, and the  component was updated to consume these real-time updates and display a progress bar.
3.  **PRIORITY 5: API for Integrations** has been partially implemented by setting up an API key management system. This involved adding endpoints in  for generating, listing, and managing API keys, along with an authentication middleware to validate these keys for external integrations.

The engineer had just finished these three priorities and was about to start implementing the remaining two: PRIORITY 2: Credit Top-up System and PRIORITY 4: Advanced User Management.
