The previous AI engineer effectively initiated the Webtools Validasi Nomor Telepon Multi-Tenant application. The current trajectory details a comprehensive enhancement phase, primarily focusing on a robust admin panel and refining user experience. Initially, the AI addressed a series of pending tasks: implementing a missing  endpoint and resolving frontend import issues in . It then tackled user-requested improvements like streamlining the admin dashboard (removing duplicate user management, enhancing professionalism, fixing sidebar behavior) and implementing advanced admin features (System Health Monitor, Audit Logs, Bulk User Operations, Advanced Analytics). The process involved extensive backend modifications () for new APIs and significant frontend refactoring of core components (, , , , and new admin-specific components). Throughout this, there were several iterative debugging cycles, particularly for frontend display errors and data handling, highlighting a dynamic problem-solving approach. The current state leaves the admin panel robust and functional, with the immediate focus shifting to refining the bulk check feature based on recent user feedback.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a persistent  error reported by the user, alongside enhancing its functionality. The user explicitly stated that despite previous fixes,  failed upon use and had several missing features. Specifically, the user requested:
1.  **Resolution of the Upload failed error** when attempting to use Bulk Check.
2.  **Support for a more flexible CSV format** that includes an optional / column in addition to the  column. The user wants the results to display the name alongside the number to identify the owner easily.
3.  **Inclusion of platform selection checkboxes** (WhatsApp/Telegram/Both), identical to those available in the  feature.

The AI engineer has just acknowledged these specific issues and has outlined a plan to update the CSV format and add platform selection. The current work is at the very beginning of addressing these Bulk Check improvements. All other prior tasks, including a comprehensive admin panel restructure, fixing various frontend display errors (, , ), implementing sidebar hide/show functionality, and integrating advanced admin features (System Health, Audit Logs, Bulk User Operations, Advanced Analytics), have been successfully completed and verified. User login, which was previously problematic, has also been confirmed by the user as working.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to update the Bulk Check feature to support a flexible CSV format (name, number) and add platform selection checkboxes.
