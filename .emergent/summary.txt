The previous AI engineer successfully launched the Webtools Validasi Nomor Telepon Multi-Tenant application. The work then transitioned to enhancing the admin panel and refining user experience. Key initial tasks included fixing  and frontend import issues. Significant effort was dedicated to restructuring the admin dashboard, adding features like System Health, Audit Logs, and Bulk User Operations, and resolving frontend display errors (e.g., in , ). User login issues were also resolved.

The most recent and challenging phase focused on the Bulk Check feature. Initial work involved implementing flexible CSV uploads (supporting ), adding platform selection checkboxes (WhatsApp/Telegram), and fixing persistent upload errors. This led to a critical discovery: the frontend  configuration clashed with , causing dual notifications. This was resolved by adjusting  handling and fixing a JavaScript  error.

The final, and ongoing, challenge revolved around the **accuracy of WhatsApp number validation**. Despite multiple iterations—including refining a web-scraping algorithm, introducing stricter scoring, debugging with cache clearing, and even attempting Playwright-based browser automation on the  endpoint—a consistent and accurate free validation method proved elusive. The core problem identified is WhatsApp's deliberate design to provide generic HTML responses to  requests, relying on client-side JavaScript for actual status checks, effectively preventing reliable server-side scraping for definitive active or inactive status for privacy and anti-bot reasons. The trajectory concludes with the AI presenting realistic options to the user.

<pending_tasks>
-   Decide on the strategy for WhatsApp validation accuracy:
    -   Accept honest low-confidence results with a disclaimer.
    -   Implement a hybrid approach (free check + paid API for critical numbers).
    -   Focus on other platforms that are more validation-friendly.
    -   Implement a user feedback system to improve accuracy over time.
-   Implement loading progress indicator for Bulk Check (requested by user, not explicitly confirmed as implemented/verified).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into solving the persistent issue of **inaccurate WhatsApp number validation** for the Bulk Check feature. The user reported that even after several fixes and improvements, the validation results were incorrect (e.g., inactive numbers being marked active).

The AI engineer performed an extensive research and testing phase, including:
1.  **Refining the server-side web scraping algorithm** for WhatsApp, including stricter scoring and improved Indonesian error detection.
2.  **Implementing a Clear Cache button** on the System Health page (requested by the user) to ensure the latest algorithm was always used for validation.
3.  **Conducting comprehensive testing with multiple validation methods** (wa.me, api.whatsapp.com, web.whatsapp.com, mobile API, business directory) using a provided list of sample numbers.
4.  **Identifying a critical technical issue**: WhatsApp's use of **Brotli compression**, which required installing the  Python package.
5.  **Performing deep browser automation inspection (using Playwright)** to analyze DOM elements, JavaScript execution, and network requests, suspecting client-side logic was key.

The **critical finding** was that WhatsApp's  endpoint (the primary free method) intentionally provides **nearly identical HTML responses for both active and inactive numbers**. The actual status determination happens client-side via JavaScript, making it impossible to achieve 100% accurate validation through server-side HTTP requests or even basic browser automation without complex, potentially ToS-violating, methods (like maintaining full WhatsApp login sessions).

The current work concluded with the AI presenting this fundamental limitation to the user and offering four realistic options for how to proceed, as 100% accurate *free* WhatsApp validation appears to be technically unfeasible due to WhatsApp's design. The user has not yet responded to these options.
