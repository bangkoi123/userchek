The AI engineer's initial task was to enhance an existing multi-tenant phone validation application, particularly focusing on the admin panel and a Bulk Check feature. Initially, significant effort went into debugging frontend/backend issues and adding admin functionalities like System Health and Audit Logs. The core challenge revolved around achieving accurate, free WhatsApp number validation. After extensive server-side scraping attempts and Playwright automation, it was concluded that a free, 100% accurate method was unfeasible due to WhatsApp's client-side validation design.

The user then explicitly requested integrating the  API for WhatsApp validation, providing an API key and documentation. The AI successfully integrated this, initially encountering issues with the API's batch-processing nature (misinterpreting it as real-time). This was resolved by implementing a batch upload system with polling for results, achieving 100% accuracy.

Subsequent user feedback highlighted issues with credit deduction, usage tracking, and critical frontend UX/UI problems in Quick Check and Bulk Check features. The AI successfully overhauled Quick Check for persistent, real-time results and Bulk Check for a live progress modal with persistent results, addressing previous real-time WebSocket connection issues with a polling fallback. The final user feedback indicates a regression in validation accuracy and a persistent layout issue.

The Webtools application is a multi-tenant platform for WhatsApp and Telegram phone number validation, focusing on UX, performance, and modern design. It offers Quick/Bulk Check, Job History, and Dashboard for users, and comprehensive management (Telegram/WhatsApp, Job Monitoring, Audit Logs) for admins. The backend handles data processing, provider integration, credit management, multi-tenancy, and authentication.

**Implemented Priorities (Previous Engineer):** Email Notifications, Real-time Job Progress (WebSockets), API for Integrations.

**Recent Feature Requests & Enhancements:**
1.  **Admin Panel Restructure:** Dashboard Admin, sidebar hide/show, Payment Management, enhanced User Management, Admin Settings, credit management.
2.  **Advanced Admin Features:** System Health Monitor, Bulk User Operations, Advanced Analytics, Audit Logs, Notification Management.
3.  **Bulk Check Improvements:** Support  CSV, platform selection (WhatsApp/Telegram), loading indicator.
4.  **Accurate WhatsApp Validation:** Explicitly requested using  API.
5.  **Quick Check UI/UX:** Persistent results after refresh, real-time counter updates, newest-first ordering, individual copy buttons, remove bulk copy button.
6.  **Bulk Check UI/UX:** Live progress table post-upload, real-time percentage, completion indicator, download/detail buttons, detail modal with pagination, persistent results.
7.  **Job History UI/UX:** Minimalist design, no loading process, ensure Quick/Bulk results are visible.
8.  **Layout Fix:** Reposition Hasil Validasi Terbaru section for prominence.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Core FastAPI application, extended to integrate  API for WhatsApp validation. It now includes  (batch processing, Excel parsing),  (provider selection), and admin endpoints for  settings. Logic in  and  uses this smart validation, including polling for batch results. ObjectId serialization was fixed for admin settings.
-   ****: Python dependencies were updated to include  and  for processing 's Excel results.
-   ****: Updated with  and  for the correct batch processing endpoint.
-   ****: Routes were initially updated to include a new  component, then reverted as the user requested integration into .
-   ****: Modified to integrate  provider settings directly into the existing WhatsApp Providers tab, including form fields and save/update logic, removing the need for a separate  file.
-   ****: Heavily modified to implement persistent validation results using , real-time counter updates, newest-first ordering, individual copy buttons, and a modernized statistics display.
-   ****: Significantly refactored for live progress modal (displaying percentage, completion indicators), persistent results section (), download/detail buttons for job results. A polling fallback was added to  in  to ensure progress updates even if WebSockets fail. Current work involves fixing its layout.
-   ****: Simplified to a minimalist design, removing progress indicators and focusing on basic job info with expandable details on click.
-   ****: Modified to remove the temporary WhatsApp Providers navigation item.
-   ****: Modified to include a polling fallback mechanism for job progress, ensuring updates if WebSocket connection is unstable.

<pending_tasks>
-   Investigate and fix the regression in WhatsApp validation accuracy, which currently appears to be using the free method despite CheckNumber.ai being configured.
-   Complete the layout reorganization for the Hasil Validasi Terbaru section in  to ensure it is prominently displayed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two critical issues reported by the user regarding the  feature:
1.  **Inaccurate Validation Results:** The user reported that validation results were no longer accurate and seemed to be using the less reliable free method instead of the integrated  API, despite it being configured.
2.  **Poor Layout:** The Hasil Validasi Terbaru (Latest Validation Results) section in  was positioned poorly (bottom right and not visible), making it difficult for users to find.

The AI engineer's current actions involve:
-   **Investigating Accuracy:** The AI checked the backend configuration, confirming  is still the active provider and that API calls are being made to it. Direct API tests also showed  is functioning. The root cause for the perceived inaccuracy is currently under investigation.
-   **Fixing Layout:** The AI initiated a layout reorganization of . This involves moving the Hasil Validasi Terbaru section to a more prominent and visible location on the page and making the header more compact, as explicitly requested by the user.

The last action recorded was the successful modification of  to start reorganizing its layout. The next immediate action is to continue with this layout fix by removing old, redundant sections.

<optional_next_step>
Continue reorganizing the layout of  by removing the outdated completed jobs section.
